# Packaged Morse Micro HaLow driver

This component is the only Morse Micro dependency exposed to the public EdgeZ
application. It contains the predefined `lib/esp32s3/libmorse.a`, the public
headers required by `main`, and the board-specific BCF in `bcf/`. Public builds
consume these supplied files directly and do not require MM-IoT source code.

Release maintainers regenerate and validate the package in the internal source
repository before publishing it. Public users should treat `libmorse.a` and the
BCF as prebuilt dependencies.

This copy was sourced from `edge-device-esp32-internal`'s `wifi-extender`
integration. Its `mm-iot-esp32` submodule is pinned to commit
`2038fddedc523d115e1c9089b30a900cc0d1384b`, which is also the starting point
of the `template-live-stocking` branch in that repository. The archive targets
ESP32-S3 and ESP-IDF 5.5.1; `firmware/platformio.ini` deliberately pins the
matching pioarduino release.

## License notice

This `libmorse.a` is an EdgeZeron AI AB modified integration containing custom
EdgeZeron code. EdgeZeron's modifications and custom code are provided only for

The generated archive combines MorseLib, HostAP, MM shims, MM IP adaptation,
packet memory, regulatory database, utilities, and firmware. The BCF remains a
separate component asset and is embedded into the application during its final
link.
